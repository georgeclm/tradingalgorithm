# Trading Algorithm
There is 2 program in here, the first one is taking all the from one year price return until 1 month price return and then count each stock value by all stocks and then take the most highest momentum to invest in On this program i use LQ45 stock to evaluate but to make the program better it should take all stock in IHSG for better result but to get all the real time data it is paid.
For the second algorithm it take the PE Ratio,PB Ratio,PS Ratio,Enterprise Value divided by Earning before taxes,depreciation and amortization Ratioa dn Enterprise Value divided by Gross Profit Ratio then count from all the data take the percentile and then return the most undervalue stock in the stock market on this example there is a lot of data that is why i only use S&P 500 free data for example only.
